# ViUR Vi

**WARNING: THIS IS AN UNSTABLE PYTHON3 / PYODIDE PORT, WORK IN PROGRESS!**

**Vi** is a web-based administration client for the [ViUR framework](https://www.viur.dev).

This is the current development version 3.0 of the Vi which aims to be running both with [ViUR 2](https://github.com/viur-framework/server) and [ViUR 3](https://github.com/viur-framework/viur-core). 

This program is now entirely built on [Pyodide](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide), the official Python 3.7 interpreter compiled to WebAssembly. Therefore it is necessary to "install" Pyodide as described below.

## Usage

Vi can be used as a submodule (see https://github.com/viur-framework/viur-base for an example) to be included into a ViUR project. 

After cloning or extracting Vi, run

```bash
get-pyodide.py
```

to download and install the latest Pyodide version as a WebAssembly runtime environment.

When you add or remove any files from the Vi repo, don't forget to call

```bash
gen-files-json.py
```

to rebuild the file `files.json` which is used to pre-fetch the Vi into Pyodide. This is also necessary when writing Vi-Plugins. See viur-base for a detailed and pre-configured setup.
