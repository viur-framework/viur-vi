# ViUR Vi

This is the web-based administration client for the [ViUR framework](https://www.viur.dev).

This program is entirely built using [Pyodide](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide), a Python 3.7 interpreter compiled to WebAssembly and entirely running in the browser.

## Usage

Vi can be used as a submodule (see https://github.com/viur-framework/viur-base for an example) to be included into a ViUR project. 

## Development

When you add or remove any files from the Vi repo, don't forget to call

```bash
gen-files-json.py
```

to rebuild the file `files.json` which is used to pre-fetch the Vi into Pyodide. This is also necessary when writing Vi-Plugins. See viur-base for a detailed and pre-configured setup.
