Vi is the web-based administration client for the [ViUR framework](https://www.viur.dev).

The software runs on any modern web browser and was built using [Flare](https://github.com/viur-framework/flare), a framework and toolkit for writing web-apps in Python, and [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org), a Python interpreter running in the browser.

## Usage

Vi can be used as a submodule or from a zip-file to be used in your ViUR projects. It runs out of the box without further dependencies.

A default [viur-base](https://github.com/viur-framework/viur-base) installation provides a guided way to include a recent Vi into your ViUR project. [viur-cli](https://github.com/viur-framework/viur-cli) supports you keeping your Vi up-to-date.
